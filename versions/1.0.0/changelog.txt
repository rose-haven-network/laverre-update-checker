## "What makes this modpack stand out from the rest?"
  
> Along side [Valerie's Adventure](https://modrinth.com/modpack/valeries-adventure), I consider Laverre to be the "LITE" version of it, less mods, better performance; Now with Laverre, I plan to make sure the performance is better, as this is the modpack I use for my "Forever World".

I spend as much time as possible between Laverre and Valerie's Adventure, I've spent roughly 16 hours debugging & fixing issues with Laverre, I intend to keep the same pace through the next versions and so on.

## "Why the name 'Laverre'?"
- Laverre includes the [Cobblemon](https://cobblemon.com/) mod, and I got the thought, I decided to name the modpack after one of my [Favorite Pokemon Gym Leader's](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Valerie) home town, [Laverre City](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Laverre_City).
